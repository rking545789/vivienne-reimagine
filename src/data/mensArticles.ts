Here's what I've learned after years of consulting on men's style: the right date outfit isn't about impressing anyone—it's about feeling confident enough to be yourself. Let me break down the formulas that actually work.",

The blazer says 'I made an effort,' the jeans say 'but I'm still approachable.' Finish with leather loafers—brown works with everything—or ultra-clean white sneakers if the venue's more casual. Wine bar? Check. Upscale restaurant? Check. Gallery opening? Double check.",

No tie. Roll those sleeves to mid-forearm. This shows intentionality without stuffiness. Stick with solid colors or micro-patterns—save the bold prints for when you know each other better. Brown or black leather oxfords complete the look. You'll look like you know what you're doing.",

Keep jewelry minimal. Make sure your shoes are actually clean—scuffed shoes will tank even the best outfit. And here's the real secret: wear something you've worn before. First dates aren't the time to break in new clothes. Comfort breeds confidence.",

Quality blazer over crew neck sweater with dark jeans shows personality while maintaining professionalism. Include one subtle personal element—distinctive glasses, quality sneakers, or minimal accessories. Research company culture thoroughly—company websites, social media, employee photos all provide context. Even in creative fields, demonstrating that you understand professional presentation matters. It shows judgment and cultural awareness.",

      ],
      conclusion: "Interview attire demonstrates preparation, judgment, and cultural understanding. Research the company and industry carefully. When uncertain, dress slightly more formally—you can always remove a tie or blazer, but you cannot add formality if underdressed. The outfit should instill confidence, not discomfort. Practice in your interview attire beforehand. Confidence in appearance translates directly to confidence in performance. Professional presentation isn't superficial—it's strategic communication that positions you for success."
